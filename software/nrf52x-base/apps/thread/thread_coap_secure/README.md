Thread COAPS to google cloud iot App
===============

Send data packets to a google cloud iot core. Utilizes [coap proxy](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/cloud-iot-coap-proxy).

To get this working on your own cloud, you need your `project-id`,
   `registry-id`, proxy `PSK_SECRET` and `PSK_IDENTITY`, and generated device
   keypair. These fields can be placed in `config.h`.
