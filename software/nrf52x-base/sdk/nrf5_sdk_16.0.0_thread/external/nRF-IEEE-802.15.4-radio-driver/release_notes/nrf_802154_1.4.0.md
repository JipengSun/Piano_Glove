# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.4.0 release notes

Release date: 2019-06-07

This release provides multiple minor updates. The most significant ones are the new pseudo-random number generator abstraction layer and the new Front End Module abstraction layer that are intended to ease porting of the driver to RTOSes. Moreover, thanks to many fixes in this area, the release contains robust delayed transmission and delayed reception operations.

## Migration guide:
Release 1.4.0 provides new files that must be added to the build system:
* src/platform/random/nrf_802154_random_stdlib.c - an example implementation of the pseudo-random number abstraction layer that uses the `rand()` function from the standard library.
* src/fal/nrf_802154_fal.c - an initial implementation of the Front End Module abstraction layer.

Due to some optimizations, one source file is deleted and must be removed from the build system:
* src/nrf_802154_ack_pending_bit.c

## New features:
* Created a pseudo-random number generator abstraction layer in the platform directory. ([PR #238](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/238))
* Implemented a new Front End Module Abstraction Layer (FAL) component. ([PR #224](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/224))
* Added a TX power setting to the continuous carrier operation. ([PR #229](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/229))
* Provided an implementation of the `assert()` function for the ARMCC compiler to facilitate the debugging process. ([PR #195](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/195))
* Added a BKPT instruction to the assert handlers. ([PR #236](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/236))
* Replaced the internal RADIO HAL (`nrf_radio.h`) implementation with the implementation provided by the [nrfx](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx) project. ([PR #221](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/221), [PR #228](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/228))

## Bug fixes:
* A request to transit to the RX state while the core already is in the RX state is correctly notified to the requester. ([PR #205](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/205))
* After a delayed transmission or a delayed reception, the driver enters the RX state regardless of the result of the delayed operation. ([PR #208](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/208), [PR #209](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/209))
* The delayed reception timeout handler preempted by the RADIO ISR handler does not lead to the undefined module state. ([PR #233](https:////github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/233))
* A single delayed reception triggers just one notification indicating the end of the procedure. ([PR #242](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/242))
* The driver core processes notifications from the radio scheduler regardless of the the state of the core. This makes delayed operations robust. ([PR #244](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/244))
* Simplified the lp_timer handling when adding a timer that should fire immediately. ([PR #214](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/214))
* Update of the ACK Information Elements for an already registered address is possible. ([PR #241](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/241))
* Pending bits in the ACK frames are handled by the `ack_data` module like the Information Elements. ([PR #243](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/243))
* The initialization of the FEM module configures only these peripherals that are used by the module in the given runtime configuration. ([PR #216](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/216))
* The types of the variables holding LQI values are unified to `uint8_t`. ([PR #210](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/210))
* The driver built without compiler optimizations does not hang during the initialization procedure. ([PR #231](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/231))
* Corrected the names of variables storing 802.15.4 frames. ([PR #234](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/234))
* Removed implicit conversions of the integer signedness in the ACK generator module. ([PR #211](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/211))
* Added missing subdirectories to the paths of the included header files. ([PR #212](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/212))
* Removed copies of dependencies from the repository. ([PR #213](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/213))

## Limitations:
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.
* The delayed operations do not detect delays caused by the ISR latency. Because of the ISR latency, the delayed transmission might be delayed for too long, or the reception window might be shorter than requested for the delayed transmission operation. To avoid such problems, it is recommended to minimize the ISR latency of the RTC instance that is used by the lp_timer module (RTC2 by default).

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end:
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues:
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid. Workaround: enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during transmission procedure works incorrectly. Workaround: enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
