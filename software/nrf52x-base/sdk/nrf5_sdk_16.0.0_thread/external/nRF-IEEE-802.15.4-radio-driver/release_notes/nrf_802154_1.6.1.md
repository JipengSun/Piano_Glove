# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.6.1 release notes

Release date: December 9, 2019

This is a bugfix release that fixes problems found in the version 1.6.0.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed a spelling issue in the FEM GPIO macro. ([PR #286](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/286))
* Fixed an issue where building with GCC4 compiler was not possible. ([PR #298](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/298))
* Fixed an issue where the CPU would be halted during the frame reception and the FEM would be disabled. ([PR #326](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/326))
* Fixed an issue where a shared PPI channel would not be cleared when the driver stopped using it. ([PR #328](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/328))
* Fixed an issue where PPI and TIMER HAL types were not cast explicitly. ([PR #330](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/330))

## Limitations
* The driver is tested only with the default configuration (that is, without changes in the nrf_802154_config.h file). Test applications are compiled with optimizations for the code size. Any other configuration and optimization level is to be considered as experimental.
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In the multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.
* The delayed operations do not detect delays caused by the ISR latency. Because of the ISR latency, the delayed transmission might be delayed for too long, or the reception window might be shorter than requested for the delayed transmission operation. To avoid such problems, it is recommended to minimize the ISR latency of the RTC instance that is used by the lp_timer module.

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v7.0.1 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check the definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid.
  * Workaround: Enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during the transmission procedure works incorrectly.
  * Workaround: Enter sleep state before the deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in the multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
  * There is no known workaround for this bug.
* Calling the API of the driver in a loop when the driver is waiting for an ACK causes the waiting for an ACK to last indefinitely, which leads to an assertion fault.
  * Workaround: Do not call the API of the driver until the last transmission request sends a notification of success or failure.
