# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.5.0 release notes

Release date: August 9, 2019

This release provides a new feature that enables the next higher layer to cancel the delayed operations. When a delayed transmission, or a delayed reception is scheduled, it can be cancelled. This functionality is needed for the implementation of CSL for multiple links.

Additionaly, this release includes several bugfixes.

## New features
* Added the option for cancelling the scheduled delayed transmissions and receptions. See [PR #247](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/247).
* Added the measurement of RSSI during the idle or active reception. See [PR #256](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/256) and [PR #261](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/261).

## Changes
* Modified the mechanism for extending the delayed reception window. Now, the window is extended only by the time needed to receive the detected frame (and acknowledge the reception if requested). See [PR #246](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/246).
  * Previously, the delayed reception window was extended automatically at the start of the reception process, based on the assumption that the detected frame is going to have the maximum possible length (127 bytes of PSDU).
* Updated the configuration of PA/LNA pins for nRF52811 to match the pinout of the nRF52840 development kit. See [PR #251](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/251).

## Bug fixes
* Fixed several race conditions in the multi-protocol configuration. See [PR #250](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/250), [PR #254](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/254), and [PR #257](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/257).
* Fixed an issue with the `BKPT` instruction that would cause faults that led to resets and prevented post-mortem debugging. Now, the `BKPT` instruction must be enabled with `ENABLE_DEBUG_ASSERT_BKPT` and is called only in the debug configuration. See [PR #254](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/254).
* Fixed the incorrect IRQ priority value for the example clock driver provided with the driver source code by changing it from 10 to 7. It is now within the acceptable MCU range. See [PR #258](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/258).
* Added a missing public function for clearing the IE data stored for the Enh-Ack frames. See [PR #259](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/259).
* Fixed the compiler warning about the unitialized pointer access in the NDEBUG configuration. See [PR #263](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/263).

## Limitations
* The driver is tested only with the default configuration (no changes in the nrf_802154_config.h file). Test applications are compiled with optimizations for the code size.
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In the multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.
* The delayed operations do not detect delays caused by the ISR latency. Because of the ISR latency, the delayed transmission might be delayed for too long, or the reception window might be shorter than requested for the delayed transmission operation. To avoid such problems, it is recommended to minimize the ISR latency of the RTC instance that is used by the lp_timer module (RTC2 by default).

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v6.1.0 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check the definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid.
  * Workaround: Enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during the transmission procedure works incorrectly.
  * Workaround: Enter sleep state prior to deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in the multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
* Calling the API of the driver in a loop when the driver is waiting for an ACK causes the waiting for an ACK to last indefinitely, which leads to an assertion fault.
  * Workaround: Do not call the API of the driver until the last transmission request sends a notification of success or failure.
