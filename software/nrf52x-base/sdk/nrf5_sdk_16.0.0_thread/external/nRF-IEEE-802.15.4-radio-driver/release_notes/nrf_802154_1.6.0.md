# nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver 1.6.0 release notes

Release date: October 3, 2019

This release introduces support for three-pin front-end modules, adds native support for S140 SoftDevice v7.0.1, and implements a new algorithm that manages Pending Bits in the acknowledgements according to the Zigbee protocol requirements.

The defines that contain the revision number of the chip are now removed, which simplifies porting the 802.15.4 driver between Nordic chips. However, this means that the first engineering version of the nRF52840 device (nRF52840 IC revision Engineering A) is no longer supported. See [IC revisions and variants](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcomp_matrix_nrf52840%2FCOMP%2Fnrf52840%2FnRF52840_ic_revision_overview.html) for more details.

Additionaly, this release includes several bug fixes.

## Migration guide
The 1.6.0 release provides a new header file that contains the configuration of all peripherals used by the 802.15.4 driver. Add the following file to the build system:
* src/nrf_802154_peripherals.h

Because of the refactoring of the chip revision management, the following source file has been deleted and must be removed from the build system:
* src/nrf_802154_revision.c

## New features
* Added support for three-pin front-end modules. See [PR #265](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/265), [PR #269](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/269), and [PR #276](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/276).
* Added an algorithm that manages Pending Bits in the acknowledgements in the Zigbee protocol. See [PR #270](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/270).
* Added a new random number generator platform that uses a reentrant function from the newlib library. See [PR #268](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/268).
* Added stubs for the Wi-Fi coexistance functionality. See [PR #272](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/272) and [PR #274](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/274).

## Changes
* Removed defines that contain the revision of the chip and removed support for the Engineering A revision of the nRF52840 device. See [PR #266](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/266) and [PR #264](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/264).
* Updated supported S140 SoftDevice to v7.0.1. See [PR #273](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/273).
* Gathered the peripheral usage information that was previously scattered across all modules into a single header file. See [PR #271](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/271).

## Bug fixes
* Removed the possibility of an uninitialized pointer access. See [PR #263](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/263).
* Fixed header path of the SoftDevice module that provides random number generator functions. See [PR #267](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/pull/267).

## Limitations
* The driver is tested only with the default configuration (that is, without changes in the nrf_802154_config.h file). Test applications are compiled with optimizations for the code size. Any other configuration and optimization level is to be considered as experimental.
* Number of supported peers for the Auto Pending Bit feature is limited to 127.
* In the multiprotocol configuration (SoftDevice RAAL), the application cannot use IRQ priority levels 2 and 3.
* The delayed operations do not detect delays caused by the ISR latency. Because of the ISR latency, the delayed transmission might be delayed for too long, or the reception window might be shorter than requested for the delayed transmission operation. To avoid such problems, it is recommended to minimize the ISR latency of the RTC instance that is used by the lp_timer module (RTC2 by default).

### Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice front end and the 802.15.4 front end
* Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice. The S140 SoftDevice v7.0.1 reserves PPI channels 17-31. Check the definition of the `NRF_SOC_SD_PPI_CHANNELS_SD_ENABLED_MSK` macro in the `nrf_soc.h` file to verify the list of reserved PPI channels.
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
* The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

## Known issues
* If `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` is disabled, a pointer to a frame passed by the transmission result notifications is invalid.
  * Workaround: Enable `NRF_802154_USE_RAW_API` if the code relies on the passed pointer.
* Deinitialization during the transmission procedure works incorrectly.
  * Workaround: Enter sleep state before the deinitialization.
* Deinitialization of the driver works incorrectly in the multiprotocol configuration (simulator or SoftDevice RAAL).
  * There is no known workaround for this bug.
* Calling the API of the driver in a loop when the driver is waiting for an ACK causes the waiting for an ACK to last indefinitely, which leads to an assertion fault.
  * Workaround: Do not call the API of the driver until the last transmission request sends a notification of success or failure.
