Virtual Timers
==============

The goal of this lab is to write a virtual timer library. You will use
one hardware timer to create a timer library that handles any number of timers.

virtual_timer_linked_list.[ch] includes a linked list implementation you can use

virtual_timer.[ch] contains the virtual timer library to be implemented

main.c uses the timer library to blink LEDs on the Microbit
