Capacitive Touch App
====================

Control an LED with the presence or absence of touch on the microbit logo pad.

The logo pad is on the same side as the LED matrix, above it. Touching should
increase the time it takes for current to drain from the logo pad, resulting
in a detectable difference on the microcontroller.
