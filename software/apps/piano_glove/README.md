## Current Version
Hi, this is the Piano Glove Project invented by Jipeng Sun and Yan Xu from Northwestern! The project is developed in and supported by Prof. Branden Ghena's CE346 Microprocessor System Design.

The Piano Glove is designed & developed for people who admire arts like music but unable to perform them. My dream is that with a pair of piano gloves and a piano, you can ideally play any piano score you want.

How to achieve this goal? In the first version, we use 1 microbit, 5 flex sensors, and 2 vibrate motors. The idea is that the next note key you need to press doesn't need to be remembered by yourself, the display on the glove will show to you and you only need to flex the corresponding finger to press that key. If flex sensor detects the correct finger flexing, the display will show you the next finger you need to flex.

Besides that basic idea, we also add left and right vibrate motor to notify you whether you need to fell or raise your scale.

Select your songs with the left/right button on the microbit, hold your hands to make a select confirm, and follow the guidence of the display and vibrator to press the correct key. You will start to enjoy the feeling of play your own piano score!

## Future Version
1. Fix the integration bug in button song selecting logics to make the score selectable.
2. Give performance feedback after playing a score.
3. Add beat into the playing logics
